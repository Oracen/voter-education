# Voter Education app

A quick app we're putting together for presenting facts and figures to voters.

## Install Instructions

Run all files out of the `voter_education` subfolder.

- Ensure flutter is installed. Use Android studio to account for the usual Google software BS
- Run `flutter pub get` to build packages

## Debugging Setup

### Emulator

- Check devices are installed with `flutter emulators`. Manually start one with `flutter emulators --launch {name}`
- Bring up the control console with `CTRL` - `SHIFT` - `P`. Start typing and select `Flutter: Select Device`
- Running the main debugger via `F5` should now run the emulated device
